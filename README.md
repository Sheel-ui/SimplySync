# SimplySync

SimplySync is a platform designed to address the challenges students face in finding suitable teammates for university projects. Traditional methods of team formation often lead to mismatched skill sets and lack of cohesion among team members, resulting in inefficiencies and suboptimal project outcomes. In response to these issues, the project aims to streamline and enhance the team formation process for students, enabling meaningful connections among like-minded collaborators.

## Overview of the Solution

The platform simplifies team creation by offering core functionalities such as:


- **Home:** Featuring user posts and suggested collaborators, this page serves as a central hub for project advertisements and team formation.

- **Profile:** A comprehensive user profile page with easy editing capabilities, providing detailed information about each user.

- **Chats:** A messaging platform for direct communication, facilitating easy collaboration and project coordination.

- **Search:** An exploration feature that allows users to search for potential project partners based on various criteria.
